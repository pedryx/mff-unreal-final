# About
This is a simple learning project made in Unreal Engine, implementing the game design outlined in the following document: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xogAqUBNG6C6H4UfFEbI5VW6uUTpX34UeMv0Qw3AWBo/edit#heading=h.da9jlkpm7fk6).

# Controls
- W/S: Move forward/backward by one step.
- A/D: Rotate left/right by 90 degrees.
- E: Use ability.

# Abilities
Each ability has a 5-second cooldown. Abilities are acquired by walking through the corresponding ability sphere. The game features the following abilities:
- Levitation (Orange): Allows the player to levitate to a certain height.
- Time Slowdown (Blue): Enables the player to slow down time.

# Obstacles
Several obstacles challenge the player's progress:
- Stepper (Black Box): A high static box.
- Crusher (Red Box): A fast-moving box that sends the player back to the starting point upon collision.

# Victory
To achieve victory, the player must collect the green sphere hidden behind the crusher obstacle. Upon reaching victory, the game exits.
